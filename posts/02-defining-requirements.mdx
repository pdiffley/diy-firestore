# Defining Our Requirements

Before we can talk about implementation details, we need to specify what the
requirements for our database will be. I will be basing our requirement list
directly off of Firestore's feature list. The sections below
give a lightning round description of the features we will be implementing, and
specify some **key terms** that I will be using over the course of this
series. If you are already well acquainted with Firestore's features feel free
to skim or skip to the summary at the bottom. Alternatively, if you have no idea
how Firestore works at all, it could be helpful to read the [Firestore's docs](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore)
which explain Firestore's features in more detail.

## Data Organization

### Documents and Collections

Our data model is going to be nearly identical to Firestore's. We will be
storing **documents** of key-value pairs inside **collections**. Every
document will have a string identifier, **document_id** and will be the child of a
collection with its own string identifier, **collection_id**. Consider the
chat room example from the
[Firestore documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/data-model#hierarchical-data).

<div className="collection">
  <div className="document-title"> <Image src="/diy-firestore/images/collection-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> rooms </div> </div>
  <div className="collections-tabbed">
    <div className="document-title"><Image src="/diy-firestore/images/document-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> roomA </div> </div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`name : 'Chat Room A'`</div>
  </div>
  <div className="collections-tabbed">
    <div className="document-title"><Image src="/diy-firestore/images/document-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> roomB </div> </div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`name : 'Chat Room B'`</div>
  </div>
</div>

We have a collection with a collection_id `rooms`. It holds multiple documents
which each represent a chat room. The two documents shown have document_id `roomA`
and `roomB`. Each of our chat room documents have a **field** with the
**key** `name` and a string **value** holding the chat room's descriptive
name.

### Subcollections

Our documents can also have subcollections. In this case, we will give each chat
room a subcollection, `messages`.



<div className="collection">
  <div className="document-title"> <Image src="/diy-firestore/images/collection-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> rooms </div> </div>
  <div className="collections-tabbed">
    <div className="document-title"><Image src="/diy-firestore/images/document-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> roomA </div> </div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`name : 'Chat Room A'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed"><div className="collections-tabbed">

<div className="collection">
  <div className="document-title"> <Image src="/diy-firestore/images/collection-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> messages </div> </div>
  <div className="collections-tabbed">
    <div className="document-title"><Image src="/diy-firestore/images/document-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> message1 </div> </div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`from : 'alex'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`message : 'Hello World!'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`messageCount: 0`</div>
  </div>
  <div className="collections-tabbed">
    <div className="document-title"><Image src="/diy-firestore/images/document-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> message2 </div> </div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`from : 'mary'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`message : 'Hello Worlds!'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`messageCount: 1`</div>
  </div>
</div>

    </div></div>
  </div>
  <div className="collections-tabbed">
    <div className="document-title"><Image src="/diy-firestore/images/document-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> roomB </div> </div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`name : 'Chat Room B'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed"><div className="collections-tabbed">

<div className="collection">
  <div className="document-title"> <Image src="/diy-firestore/images/collection-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> messages </div> </div>
  <div className="collections-tabbed">
    <div className="document-title"><Image src="/diy-firestore/images/document-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> message1 </div> </div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`from : 'jeff'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`message : 'Lorem'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`messageCount: 0`</div>
  </div>
  <div className="collections-tabbed">
    <div className="document-title"><Image src="/diy-firestore/images/document-dark.png" alt="drawing" height="30" width="30" /> <div className="document-name"> message2 </div> </div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`from : 'alex'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`message : 'Ipsum'`</div>
    <div className="collections-tabbed">`messageCount: 1`</div>
  </div>
</div>

    </div></div>
  </div>
</div>



The `messages` subcollection holds all of the messages in the chat room. In this
case, each message document has three fields, `from`, `message`, and
`messageCount` which store the name of the message's sender, the content of the
message, and the number of messages that have been sent.

### Document Identifiers and Uniqueness

Documents and collections are uniquely identified in the database by the path
from their root collection. This includes all parent collections and document
ids.

For example, the full unique identifier for the `messages` collection in `roomA` is  
`"/rooms/roomA/messages"`

and the full unique identifier for `message1` in `roomA` is  
`"/rooms/roomA/messages/message1"`

We will break these unique identifiers into three components. The first two,
**document_id** and **collection_id**, we have already seen. The third is
**collection_parent_path** and encompasses everything in a documents unique
path prior to it's collection. For example, the collection_parent_path for the
messages collection above is `"/rooms/roomA"`. The collection_parent_path for top
level collections (eg. `rooms`) is just an empty string.

In general the unique identifier for any collection takes the form

`"/<collection_parent_path>/<collection_id>/"`

and the unique identifier for any document takes the form

`"/<collection_parent_path>/<collection_id>/<document_id>"`

## Data Types

Firestore allows documents to have values of the following datatypes

Null  
Boolean  
64 bit Integer  
64 bit Float  
DateTime  
String  
Bytes  
Document Reference  
Geographic Point  
Array  
Map

We will support all of these types except Array, Map, and Geographic Point.
Supporting Array and Map types is very doable, but including these types
initially will muddle the explanation of some the more fundamental concepts our
database will utilize. The geographic point type is currently not
recommended for use, so I am just going to ignore it entirely.

Because documents can have values with different types for the same field key,
we need a consistent way to compare field values with different types. For this
purpose the different types will be ordered based on their position in the list
above (ie. a null type is always less than a boolean type which is always less
than an integer and so on). The only exception to this is that integers and floats
will be ordered based on their numberic value (eg. `1 < 2.5 < 3 < 3.5`).

## Queries

Following [Firestore's terminolgy](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/query-data/queries), 
we will classify queries as either **simple** or **compound** and will allow queries on
**collections** as well as **collection groups**. A collection group is any group of collections
that have the same collection_id.

### Simple Queries

Simple queries have only one constraint. Using our message room example from
above, if we wanted to get all of the messages in roomA that were sent by "alex"
we could write the query,

```typescript
query("rooms/roomA/messages", where("from", "=", "alex"));
```

We will support simple queries on all document fields for the operators `<`,
`<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, and `!=` without advanced notice that the query will be
made (ie. without the need to make a new index for the query).

### Collection Groups

We will also support queries on **collection groups**. A collection group is a
set of collections that all have the same collection_id. If we wanted to get all
of the messages sent by "alex" to any chat room, we could write

```typescript
query(collectionGroup('messages'), where('from', '=', 'alex'))
```

This will retrieve all of the messages with sender "alex" from all messages
subcollections.

### Compound Queries

Compound queries allow you to specify multiple constraints. If we wanted to get
messages sent by "alex" that were in the first 500 messages sent to roomA we
could write the query

```typescript
query(
  "rooms/roomA/messages",
  where("from", "=", "alex"),
  where("messageCount", "<", 500)
);
```

Compound queries have some restrictions though. First, we will require that
fields used in a compound query be specified in advance in a **composite field
group** (see the next section for details). Second, only one field in the query
can have a non-equality operator (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `!=`) placed on it. All
other fields can only be constrained by the equality operator. For example, the
query

```typescript
query(
  "rooms/roomA/messages",
  where("from", "!=", "alex"),
  where("messageCount", "<", 500)
);
```

would not be allowed. But why would you want to exclude Alex anyway?

### Composite Field Groups

Before we can make a compound query on a set of fields, we will require the user
to specifiy a **composite field group**, this will allow us to make the tables 
and indexes required to support the query. For the above query, we would specify the 
composite fields

```typescript
{
  collectionPath: "/rooms/roomA/messages",
  groupType: "COLLECTION",
  fields: ["from", "messageCount"]
}
```
Here we indicate that we are specifying we want to run queries on the 
collection `/rooms/roomA/messages`, and that we want include
the fields "from" and "messageCount" in a single query.

This only lets us run queries on one `messages` collection though (the one that 
is a child to `roomA`). Most likely, we would want to run queries on all `messages`
collections. To do that we would specify the composite group below.

```typescript
{
  collectionPath: "messages",
  groupType: "COLLECTION_GROUP",
  fields: ["from", "messageCount"]
}
```
Here we indicate that we are specifying the group of composite fields for all
individual collections with collection_id `messages`. We can the run queries over
that collection group.

In this series, we are going to assume that we have already parsed a config file that 
specifies all of the composite groups that will be queried. For a production
database, we would want to be able to update this config dynamically and also be able to specify
the relative order that the fields will be sorted in by default, but those two features will be
out of scope for this series.

## Subscriptions

One of the key features of Firestore is that our client side applications can
subscribe to changes in collections and queries and be notified when updates are
made in real time. We could create the subscription below to print messages sent
from Alex to roomA.

```typescript
let q = query(
  "rooms/roomA/messages",
  where("from", "==", "alex"),
  where("messageCount", "<", 500)
);

let unsubscribeHandler = onSnapshot(q, (querySnapshot) => {
  const messages = [];
  querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
    messages.push(doc.data().message);
  });
  console.log(messages);
});
```

Every time Alex sends a message to the chat room, the results of the query will
change and our subscription will receive the updated list of messages. Once new
messages from Alex have a `messageCount` greater than 500, the subscription will
stop firing because a new message will not change the query results.

We will also support subscriptions to changes in individual documents,
collections, and collection groups.

## Optimistic Transactions

Like Firestore, we will support client side transactions with
[optimistic concurrency](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/transaction-data-contention#data_contention_in_the_mobileweb_sdks).
For example, if we wanted our client side app to be able to update the `count`
field in the document `counter` in collection `counter_collection`, we could
write the transaction

```typescript
await runTransaction(db, async (transaction) => {
  let counterDoc = await transaction.get("/counter_collection/counter");
  let currentCount = counterDoc.data().count;
  transaction.update("/counter_collection/counter", { count: currentCount + 1 });
});
```

This code will read the counter document, update it with the new value and rollback
if there was contention. Like Firestore, we will require that all reads made in a 
transaction be made before any writes.

## Pessimistic Transactions

Optimistic transactions fail automatically if there is contention around a
document write. This makes them ill suited for cases where multiple clients are
likely to be writing to the same document at the same time. Firestore advertises
that it has server side transactions that run with
[pessimistic concurrency](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/transaction-data-contention#data_contention_in_the_server_client_libraries),
but there is
[some contention](https://github.com/googleapis/nodejs-firestore/issues/785)
(sorry) over how effective their pessimistic concurrency controls are.
Firestore's pessimistic concurrency ensures that when there is contention on a
document at least one transaction attempting to modify the document can
complete, but all other transactions attempting to modify the document will have
to retry and will ultimately fail if the 5 retry limit is reached. This is
instead of queuing the contested transactions and completing them in the order
they were made. Personally, when I have used Firestore's server side transactions in the
past, they did not live up to my expectations for how a pessimistic transaction
should behave. We are going to leave pessimistic transactions out of this series' implementation.

## Client Libraries

Firestore's client libraries play an important role in making the database useable,
managing subscriptions and transactions for example. However, in this series, I will 
only be demonstrating the server side code needed to support the database.

We are also going to hopscotch right over security rules. For this series, we will assume 
that any requests have already passed through an auth layer.

## Summary

- Our database will store **documents** and in heirarchical **collections**.

- Collections are uniquely identified by their **collection_id** and
  **collection_parent_path**

- A document is uniquely identified by their **document_id** and the unique
  identifier of its parent collection

- Documents consist of **fields** with string **keys** and **values** with one
  of the following types: null, boolean, 64 bit integer, 64 bit float, DateTime,
  String, Bytes, Document Reference.
- We will support **simple queries** on any field with the operators (`<`,
  `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) without the need for fields that are queried to
  be specified in advance
- We will support **compound queries**, but the fields that will be queried
  need to be specified in advance. Additionally, non-equality operators are only
  allowed on one field in a compound query.
- Queries can be performed on an individual collections or a **collection
  groups** (group of collections which all have the same collection_id)
- Client side applications can subscribe to real time updates of documents,
  collections, and queries.
- We will support client side transactions with optimistic concurrency

Now that we know what we are building, we can put together the foundation of our
database!
