# Composite Query Subscriptions

Supporting subscriptions to composite queries is one of the most complex features we will support.
When we added support for composite queries, we just needed to make a table with columns for each 
of fields we would perform a query over. To support subscriptions however, we need to make a table 
that supports looking up any type of query we might make on those fields. 

## Primary Constraints
In the last section, we made the range of queries we have to support more manageable by only allowing inequality 
constraints on the primary field. That said, we still have to support any combination of 6 
operators (`<`, `<=`,` >`, `>=`, `=`, and `!=`) on that field, which makes it difficult to
define a concise schema that can describe all of the queries users are subscribed to. Fortunately,
our inequality operators have redudancies, and we can consolidate a query's constraints 
to reduce this complexity significantly.

To show how we will do this, let's imagine putting our field_values on a number line.

<Image src="/diy-firestore/images/number-line.svg" alt="number line with a min and max field value" height="100" width="600" />

All the way to the left we have our designated minimum value, and all the way to
the right, we have the maximum value.

Now let's imagine that we place two "greater than" constraints on the field_value in
our query. `x > A` and `x > B` where `A < B`

<Image src="/diy-firestore/images/number-line-inequality.svg" alt="number line with field value A to the left of field value B" height="100" width="600" />

It's immediately apparent that we have some redundancy here. Regardless of how
many "greater than" constraints we put on our field value, only the one with the
lowest parameter value is going to matter. Based on that we know that our queries only need
to support one constraint of a "greater than" variety. This applies the the "less than" type
operators as well.

We still have two types of greater than operator though, "greater than" and "greater than
or equal to". Notice that the greater than operation can also be expressed as a
combination of the `>=` operation and a `!=` operation. That is, `x > A` is equivalent to `x >= A AND x != A`. So anytime we receive a
query with a `>` operator we can convert is to be written in terms of the `>=`
operator and the `!=` operator. As far as our subscription table's schema is concerned, we can pretend
like the `>` operator does not exist. The same logic applies to "less than" constraints, allowing
us to eliminate the `<` operator.

We can also express the "=" operation as a combination of `<=` and `>=`
operators. That is `x = A` is equivalent to `x <= A AND x >= A`.

All of this together means that we can take any set of constraints on our
primary field and reduce those constraints to a single `<=` condition, a single
`>=` condition, and a set of `!=` conditions. This is a set of constraints that
we can reasonably represent through a single schema.

Unfortunately, there is not much we can do to reduce the set of `!=` operators. A user can
specify as many `!=` constraints as they want and we can't consolidate them.

## Secondary Constraints

The secondary constraints are much easier to manage. For any secondary field in
a field group, only constraints with the "=" operator are allowed, so this does
not add much complexity.

## Subscription tables

With our reduced constraint set, we can now make a pair of tables to describe all
of the subscribed queries for our composite field group

```sql
CREATE TABLE composite_included_table_d8b8c614b73546daa1d85531dc412ef6(
  min_age           field_value,
  max_age           field_value,
  city              field_value,
  user_name         field_value,
  zipcode           field_value
  subscription_id   TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY (subscription_id)
);
```

```sql
CREATE TABLE composite_excluded_table_d8b8c614b73546daa1d85531dc412ef6 (
  excluded_age      field_value,
  subscription_id   TEXT,
  PRIMARY KEY (excluded_age, subscription_id)
);
```

The first "included" table has one row for every subscription that specifies the
`<=` and `>=` constraint on the primary field and the "=" constraints on the
secondary fields. The second "excluded" table has a row for every "!=" constraint on the primary
field.

We can then get all of the matching subscriptions with a query like.
```sql
-- included values
(SELECT subscription_id
FROM composite_included_table_d8b8c614b73546daa1d85531dc412ef6
WHERE min_age >= 25 AND max_age <= 25 AND user_name = "John" 
AND city = "Memphis" AND zipcode = "38125")

EXCEPT

-- excluded values
(SELECT distinct subscription_id
FROM composite_excluded_table_d8b8c614b73546daa1d85531dc412ef6
WHERE excluded_age = 25)
```
Here we get all the subscripition ids for queries that match the document's main parameters
(note that I am omitting the syntax for specifying the documents parameters as field_values). 
Then we will select the subscription ids of queries that exclude the document's age, and remove
them from the result.


The actual code for creating that query and getting the matching subscriptions
gets pretty knarly, but we can reduce that complexity as well with the power of 
elipses

```rust
fn get_matching_composite_query_subscriptions(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  document: &Document,
  composite_groups: &[CompositeFieldGroup],
) -> Vec<String> {
  let mut matching_subscriptions: Vec<String> = vec![];
  // ...todo
  matching_subscriptions
}
```

Amazing what you can do with three little dots right?

If you really want to see sample code for that function, you can find it in the
[github project](https://github.com/pdiffley/diy-firestore) for this series. 
For now, we will just pretend like we implemented it, add
it to our create and delete functions, and call it a day.

```rust focus=20
fn create_document(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str,
  update_id: &str,
  document: &Document,
  composite_groups: &[CompositeFieldGroup],
) {
  let mut encoded_document: Vec<u8> = vec![];
  document.encode(&mut encoded_document).unwrap();

  add_document_to_documents_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, update_id, &encoded_document);
  add_document_to_simple_query_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, document);
  add_document_to_composite_query_tables(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, document, composite_groups);

  let mut matching_subscriptions = vec![];
  matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_basic_subscription_ids(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id).into_iter());
  matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_simple_query_subscriptions(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document).into_iter());
  matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_composite_query_subscriptions(transaction, document, composite_groups).into_iter());

  // Todo: send update to matching subscriptions
}
```

```rust focus=16
pub fn delete_document(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str,
  composite_groups: &[CompositeFieldGroup],
) {
  if let Some(document) = get_document(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id) {
    delete_document_from_documents_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id);
    delete_document_from_simple_query_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id);
    delete_document_from_composite_query_tables(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, composite_groups);

    let mut matching_subscriptions = vec![];
    matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_basic_subscription_ids(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id).into_iter());
    matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_simple_query_subscriptions(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, &document).into_iter());
    matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_composite_query_subscriptions(transaction, &document, composite_groups).into_iter());

    // Todo: send update to matching subscriptions
  }
}
```

Similarly, I am going to leave out the code to create a new compound subscription, but it is visible in the github repo as well.

## Next up

We have written the code we need to monitor updates to any subscriptions to
our database. Next, we will go through how we can listen for updates from a client.
