### Subscription Updates

So far we have written code that identifies what subscriptions need to be
updated when a write is made to the database, but we have not specified how the
subscriptions will be updated.

A naive implemenation, would just notify the client of a subscription that a
subscription was updated, and have it re-query the data.

That leads to some n^2 behavior though, rereading an entire collection everytime
a document is added for example, and also introduces the possibility that a
message would be dropped resulting in a subscription being out of date until the
next write that affected it comes through.

When write affects a subscription, we need a way to reliably send the subscriber
only the changes that have been made without losing any state. We will create a
"queue" (I use the term loosely) for each subscription a client has, when a
subscription is affected by a write, the update will be written to the queue.
The client can the retrieve all of the changes for its subscriptions from the
update queue.

We will put all of our queues into a table, update queues.

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE update_queues (
  subscription_id             TEXT,
  collection_parent_path      TEXT,
  collection_id               TEXT,
  document_id                 TEXT,
  document_data               BYTEA,
  update_id                   TEXT
);
```

Each row in this table specifies a subscription and an updated document for the
subscription. If the document was deleted, we will set document_data to NULL.
The code add modified documents to the update queues is fairly straightforward

```rust
pub fn write_change_to_update_queues(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  matching_subscriptions: &[String],
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str,
  update_id: &str,
  document_data: &Option<Vec<u8>>)
{
  for subscription_id in matching_subscriptions {
    transaction.execute(
      "delete from update_queues where subscription_id = $1 and collection_parent_path = $2 and collection_id = $3 and document_id = $4",
      &[&subscription_id, &collection_parent_path, &collection_id, &document_id],
    ).unwrap();
    transaction.execute(
      "insert into update_queues values ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, $6)",
      &[&subscription_id, &collection_parent_path, &collection_id, &document_id, &document_data, &update_id]).unwrap();
  }
}
```

For each subscription affected by the update, we delete the existing document
from its update queue if there is one, then insert the new document. Now we just
pop this function into our create and delete functions

```rust
fn create_document(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str,
  update_id: &str,
  document: &Document,
  composite_groups: &[CompositeFieldGroup],
) {
  let mut encoded_document: Vec<u8> = vec![];
  document.encode(&mut encoded_document).unwrap();

  add_document_to_documents_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, update_id, &encoded_document);
  add_document_to_simple_query_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, document);
  add_document_to_composite_query_tables(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, document, composite_groups);

  let mut matching_subscriptions = vec![];
  matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_basic_subscription_ids(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id).into_iter());
  matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_simple_query_subscriptions(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document).into_iter());
  matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_composite_query_subscriptions(transaction, document, composite_groups).into_iter());

  write_change_to_update_queues(transaction, &matching_subscriptions, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, update_id, &Some(encoded_document));
}
```

```rust
	pub fn delete_document(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str,
  composite_groups: &[CompositeFieldGroup],
) {
  if let Some(document) = get_document(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id) {
    delete_document_from_documents_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id);
    delete_document_from_simple_query_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id);
    delete_document_from_composite_query_tables(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, composite_groups);

    let mut matching_subscriptions = vec![];
    matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_basic_subscription_ids(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id).into_iter());
    matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_simple_query_subscriptions(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, &document).into_iter());
    matching_subscriptions.extend(get_matching_composite_query_subscriptions(transaction, &document, composite_groups).into_iter());

    let update_id: String = Uuid::new_v4().as_simple().to_string();
    write_change_to_update_queues(transaction, &matching_subscriptions, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, &update_id, &None);
  }
}
```

Because our update queues are just another table in our postgres database we can
update the queues in the same transaction that all other associated
modifications are made it ensuring that we never drop any updates. When we
deliver the update to the subscribing client, we just need to confirm that the
client has received the update before removing items from the update queue.

### Next up

We now have a table holding update queues for all of our subscriptions, but we
still need to provide a way for the clients to reliably retrieve those updates.
In the next section we will look at how we can reliably deliver these updates to
the client.
