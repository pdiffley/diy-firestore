### Security Rules

<Intro>

We are going to hopscotch over security rules a bit. Firestore allows a user to
provide a configuration file that will take the information in a request and
determine if the user is allowed to access the resources requested in it. For
our purposes, we are just going to assume that we will take a similar
configuration file. We will then provide a function that will be called whenever
a relevant operation is performed

```rust
pub fn operation_is_allowed(user_id: &Option<String>, operation: &Operation, collection_parent_path: &Option<String>,
                            collection_id: &str, document_id: &Option<String>) -> bool {
  // Check if an operation is allowed
}

pub enum Operation {
  Get,
  List,
  Create,
  Update,
  Delete,
}

pub enum UserId {
  Admin,
  User(Option<String>),
}
```

This function will compare the request details against the rules specified in
the security rules file. If the user is allowed to perform the operation the
function will return true, and if not it will return false.

We can go ahead and put these security rules into our read and write functions.

```
write function code
```

most basic verison of security rules is a function implemented with the rest of
the code called whenever a document is read, written or listed args: doc id,
operation type, document returns bool for whether operation is allowed

most flexible and performant

flexibility could be a draw back, because you don't have a structure to base
your rules off of

Other approach would be to run a sidecar server with the security rules

- makes it easy to write your security rules in your frontend language of choice

Writing your security rules in an existing programming language has a couple big
benefits

- useful compilation errors. Writing rules in a config file can be error prone
  and error messages are almost always inferior to those of an actual
  programming language
- You can unit test your security rule function with existing test suites

Draw back is you have to deploy your security rules like code rather than as a
config upload, but that isn't a problem for us since we are already deploying
the whole database ourselves for just our use.

Could also make a config file set up like firestore uses, but then you lose the
ability to get useful compilation errors

If you like the structure of Firestore's security rules, it would not be hard to
make a wrapper function to process a list of regex rules
