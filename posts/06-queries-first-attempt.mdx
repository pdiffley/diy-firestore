## Queries: first attempt

Because we are storing our schema-less document data in a single binary column,
we can’t directly query our document data. To get around this, we will create a
lookup table that we will use to query our documents.

### Simple Queries

First, let’s look at how we will support simple queries on a single field.
Firestore allows us to query documents in a collection based on a single field
without specifying what fields we want to query in advance. Because we have no
knowledge of what fields we will query in advance, we can’t structure the schema
of our lookup table around specific queries or documents. Instead, we need a
generic was to query documents based on any field a user wants to search for at
run time. To that end, we will create the lookup table `simple_query_lookup`

```postgresql
CREATE TABLE simple_query_lookup (
  collection_parent_path      TEXT,
  collection_id               TEXT,
  document_id                 TEXT,
  field_name                  TEXT,
  field_value                 field_value,
  PRIMARY KEY (collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, field_name)
);
```

Each row in our table has a unique identifier for a document
(collection_parent_path, collection_path, doc_id), the name of a field within
that document and that field’s value. Now, when we write a document to the
database, we will also add all of its fields to our lookup table.

There is one odd thing about the schema of our table though. The field_value
column has the type field_value. This is definitely not a native type supported
by Postgres, so what is going on here?

### Creating a custom type

Any field in our document can have multiple data types which makes it difficult
to store the field values in our table. Like with our protobuf, we need to
create a type that can represent any of the subtypes that can be assigned to our
field values. Conveniently, Postgres has a "create type" function that will let
us do just that. There are
[several options](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html)
for creating a type. We will create a composite type with type field_value with
the following command

```postgresql
CREATE TYPE "Unit" AS ENUM ('NotNull');

CREATE TYPE field_value AS (
  min               "Unit",
  null_value        "Unit",
  boolean_value     BOOLEAN,
  integer_value     INT8,
  double_value      FLOAT8,
  timestamp_nanos   INT8,
  timestamp_seconds INT8,
  string_value      TEXT,
  bytes_value       bytea,
  reference_value   TEXT,
  max               "Unit"
);

```

Our field_value type has values that can be set to represent any of the
datatypes that will be held in our database. We do not have the convenient
"oneof" feature that protobuf has, but for a given field, we will set the unused
types to null. Note that if our value represents a timestamp, both the
timestamp_nanos and timestamp_seconds field will have a value. We also created a
`min` and `max` field so that internally, we can have a field value that is
smaller or larger than any valid field input by the user.

Composite types in Postgres behave similarly to rows in a table, and we can
create an instance of our variable with similar syntax.

```postgresql
CAST((,,5,,,,,,) as field_value)
```

Here we create a row type holding the integer value 5, then cast it so postgres
will recognize it as our composite field_value type.

### Composite Type Ordering

We have a problem though. Postgres does not know how to properly order our
field_value type. Consider the following example.

```postgresql
SELECT * FROM ( VALUES
	(CAST((NULL, NULL, NULL, 2, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) AS field_value)),
	(CAST((NULL, NULL, NULL, 1, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) AS field_value)),
	(CAST((NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 1.0, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL) AS field_value)))
  AS test_table(field_value)
ORDER BY field_value ASC;

```

Running this command which attempts to put two field values in ascending order
results in the output

```
  field_value
---------------
 (,,,1,,,,,,,)
 (,,,2,,,,,,,)
 (,,,,1,,,,,,)
```

The default comparison operator for composite values evaluates fields based on
the order they are listed. Because integer_value comes before float_value in our
compsite type, Postgres considers our integer value 2 to be less than our float
value 1. To query our field values correctly, we need to create custom
comparison operators that tell Postgres how we want the values to be ordered.

### Next up

We're going to get into some nitty gritty Postgres details to tell Postgres how
to work with our user defined type, field_value.
