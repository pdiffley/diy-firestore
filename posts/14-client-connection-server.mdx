# Update Delivery

We have done pretty much all of the heavy lifting to provide clients with
incrementally updating real time subscriptions to queries. We just need a way
for our server to notify clients when they have updates to retrieve.

Let's look at a system diagram for how we will do this:

<Image src="/diy-firestore/images/diy-firestore-system-design.svg" alt="system diagram with boxes for clients, database server, RabbitMQ, and long poll server" height="600" width="600" />

The system has 4 main pieces, the database server that we have spent most of
this case study writing, a message queue (RabbitMQ is specified here, but SQS or
PubSub would work as well), a long polling server, and the actual clients.

The basic workflow is that a client will talk to the database server to
subscribe to a query. The client will also connect to the long polling server so
that we can send updates to the client from our backend. Then when a document
is written to the database that affects one of our clients subscriptions, the
database server will send a message through RabbitMQ to the long polling server,
which will notify the client of the update.

I won't implement this entire server connection here, but we can outline the code
for this workflow.

First let's look at our long polling endpoint

```rust
const LONG_POLL_TIME_SECONDS: u64 = 20;

pub fn listen_for_update(sql_client: &mut Client, user_client_id: &str) {
  record_client_ping(sql_client, user_client_id);

  // Todo: Subscribe to RabbitMQ
  //		on message queue notification for user_client_id
  //    	close request with message that client should retrieve updates

  if client_is_out_of_date(sql_client, user_client_id) {
    // Todo: close request with message that client should retrieve updates
  }

  sleep(Duration::new(LONG_POLL_TIME_SECONDS, 0));
  // Todo: close request with message that client is up to date
}

pub fn client_is_out_of_date(
  sql_client: &mut Client, 
  user_client_id: &str) -> bool {
  return sql_client.query(
    "SELECT 1 FROM client_subscriptions C JOIN update_queues U
     ON C.subscription_id = U.subscription_id
     WHERE C.client_id = $1
     LIMIT 1",
    &[&user_client_id])
    .unwrap().len() == 0;
}
```

This function first subscribes to RabbitMQ messages tagged for the client id,
then checks if any updates have been pushed to its queue since it last checked
in with the long polling server, and then waits. If there are existing updates
for the client, or if there there is a message from RabbitMQ, the request is
closed, notifying the client that it needs to retrieve updates for its
subscriptions. If there are no updates in `LONG_POLL_TIME_SECONDS`, the request
closes with a message that the client is up to date. At this point, the client
will re-open the connection to listen for further updates.

If the client is notified that it has pending updates, it will request those
updates from the database server

```rust
pub fn get_updates(
  sql_client: &mut Client, 
  user_client_id: &str) -> Vec<UpdateValue> {
  sql_client.query(
    "SELECT subscription_id, collection_parent_path, collection_id, 
            document_id, document_data, update_id
     FROM client_subscriptions C JOIN update_queues U
     ON C.subscription_id = U.subscription_id
     WHERE C.client_id = $1
     LIMIT 1",
    &[&user_client_id])
    .unwrap().into_iter()
    .map(|row| UpdateValue {
      subscription_id: row.get(0),
      collection_parent_path: row.get(1),
      collection_id: row.get(2),
      document_id: row.get(3),
      document_data: row.get(4),
      update_id: row.get(5),
    })
    .collect()
}
```

Then after receiving the updates, the client will confirm that it received the updates,
so the database server can clear them from the update queue.

```rust
pub fn confirm_updates(
  sql_client: &mut Client, 
  user_client_id: &str, 
  update_ids: &[String]) 
{
  sql_client.execute(
    "delete FROM update_queues U USING client_subscriptions C
     where U.subscription_id = C.subscription_id and C.client_id = $1 and 
     U.update_id IN $2",
    &[&user_client_id, &update_ids]).unwrap();
}
```

Here we are using the update_id to make sure we do not delete updates for
documents that have been updated again since the client initially retrieved the
updates.

And that's it! We have a system that can allow a client to subscribe to database
queries and be notified of changes without data loss.

## Why Long Polling?

There are a several options for how we could support sending messages from our
server to our clients (eg. websockets, server sent events), so why are we using
long polling?

Long polling has quite a few benefits for our use case. The first is that unlike
websockets and server sent events, any individual client's connection automatically resets
after the long poll window (set to 20 seconds above). This allows us to set up
mostly stateless servers that are trivial to horizontally scale and load
balance. We can scale a set of distributed long polling servers up and down and
not worry about interrupting client connections.

Websockets and server sent events are relatively easy to scale vertically, but
distributing those connections across multiple servers becomes a more
complicated and expensive task with additional complications to make sure that
load is adequately balanced both by the number of connections per server and the
number of messages being sent and received by each server.

Even though we may not strictly require horizontal scaling for our use case, the
easy horizontal scaling provided by long polling will let us easily autoscale
our client connection servers, reducing cloud costs.

Long polling also provides us with built in retryability. The chain of events 
between finishing our database transaction and notifying the client that it
needs to request updates is not guaranteed to go
unbroken. However, because our client will be reconnecting to our long polling
server every 30 seconds or so, a rare dropped message will only result in a short
delay before the client identifies that it needs to request updates.

Websockets are preferable to long polling in some cases. If
we required higher frequency message passing between our client and server
(synchronizing state in a multiplayer game for example), websockets would likely
a better choice. We don't need that rate of message passing though, so the drawbacks
of websockets outweigh the benefits.
