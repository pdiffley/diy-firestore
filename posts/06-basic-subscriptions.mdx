# Basic Subscriptions

The ability to subscribe to changes in database state is a key feature of
Firestore that distinguishes it from other databases. For any query we can
make, we can create a listener that receives updates whenever the database 
changes in a way that would affect that query's results.

Supporting this feature introduces significant system design complications
though. A naive approach would have each listener poll our database for
updates. This quickly becomes unscaleable because the polling would repeatedly
send the same queries to the database regardless of whether the query results
have changed. Even at a small scale, this approach would hammer our database
with expensive requests, almost none of which would return new information to the
client.

A better approach is to check for updates when we write to the database and send
an update to any subscribed queries that are affected by a particular write.
This raises another issue though. Assuming we have a large number of users each
with their own set of subscriptions, we can't just check every subscribed query
to see if it is affected by an update every time we write to the database.

When we write a document to the database, we need a way to efficiently select
the set of subscriptions that are affected by the write. In short, we need to
query the set of database subscriptions.

## Select subscriptions affected by a write

To that end, we will create a table, `basic_subscriptions`, where we will
track subscriptions to documents, collections, and collection groups

```sql
CREATE TABLE basic_subscriptions (
  collection_parent_path      TEXT,
  collection_id               TEXT,
  document_id                 TEXT,
  subscription_id             TEXT
  PRIMARY KEY (subscription_id)
);
```

Each row represents a subscription and the relevant identifiers for it. A
subscription to a document will specify all three document identifiers,
collection_parent_path, collection_id, and document_id, a subscription to a
collection will leave document_id null, and a subscription to a collection group
will leave both collection_parent_path and document_id null.

So that we can query these values efficiently, we'll create the index

```sql
CREATE INDEX basic_subscriptions_idx
ON basic_subscriptions(collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id);
```

Now we can write a function that will take a document id and return any
subscriptions affected by that document.

```rust
pub fn get_matching_basic_subscription_ids(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str) -> Vec<String>
{
  let document_subscriptions: Vec<String> = transaction.query(
    "SELECT subscription_id
    from basic_subscriptions
    where collection_parent_path=$1 and collection_id=$2 and document_id=$3",
    &[&collection_parent_path, &collection_id, &document_id],
  ).unwrap().iter()
    .map(|x| x.get(0)).collect();

  let collection_subscriptions: Vec<String> = transaction.query(
    "SELECT subscription_id
    from basic_subscriptions
    where collection_parent_path=$1 and collection_id=$2 and 
    document_id IS NULL",
    &[&collection_parent_path, &collection_id],
  ).unwrap().iter()
    .map(|x| x.get(0)).collect();

  let collection_group_subscriptions: Vec<String> = transaction.query(
    "SELECT subscription_id
    from basic_subscriptions
    where collection_parent_path IS NULL and collection_id=$1 and 
    document_id IS NULL",
    &[&collection_id],
  ).unwrap().iter()
    .map(|x| x.get(0)).collect();

  let all_matching_subscriptions: Vec<String> =
    document_subscriptions.into_iter()
      .chain(collection_subscriptions.into_iter())
      .chain(collection_group_subscriptions.into_iter())
      .collect();
  all_matching_subscriptions
}
```
This function runs three queries on the basic_subscriptions table, 
selecting document, collection, and collection group subscriptions 
that match the specified document's identifiers.

To identify the subscriptions affected by a write, we will then add 
that function to our create and delete document methods.

```rust focus=14:17
fn create_document(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str,
  update_id: &str,
  document: &Document,
) {
  let mut encoded_document: Vec<u8> = vec![];
  document.encode(&mut encoded_document).unwrap();

  add_document_to_documents_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id, update_id, &encoded_document);

  let mut matching_subscriptions = vec![];
  matching_subscriptions.extend(
    get_matching_basic_subscription_ids(transaction, collection_parent_path, 
      collection_id, document_id).into_iter());

  // Todo: send update to matching subscriptions
}
```

```rust focus=10:14
pub fn delete_document(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str,
) {
  if let Some(document) = get_document(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id) {
    delete_document_from_documents_table(transaction, collection_parent_path, collection_id, document_id);

    let mut matching_subscriptions = vec![];
    matching_subscriptions.extend(
      get_matching_basic_subscription_ids(transaction, collection_parent_path, 
        collection_id, document_id).into_iter());

    // Todo: send update to matching subscriptions
  }
}
```

Later in the series, we will show how we will actually deliver updates to these 
subscriptions. For now, we know that whenever we write to the
database we can efficiently get the list of subscriptions that need to receive an update.

## Subscribing to a query

To support subscribing to a query in the first place, we will create another table `client_subscriptions`,

```sql
CREATE TABLE client_subscriptions (
  subscription_id     TEXT,
  client_id           TEXT
);
```

When a client subscribes to a query we will generate a new subscription id and
put it into this table along with the client's id. Then we insert a new row in `basic_subscriptions` 
for the query, as shown in this `subscribe_to_document` function

```rust
pub fn subscribe_to_document(
  transaction: &mut Transaction,
  client_id: &str,
  collection_parent_path: &str,
  collection_id: &str,
  document_id: &str,
) -> String
{
  let subscription_id: String = Uuid::new_v4().as_simple().to_string();
  transaction.execute("insert into client_subscriptions values ($1, $2)",
                      &[&subscription_id, &client_id]).unwrap();
  transaction.execute("insert into basic_subscriptions values ($1, $2, $3, $4)",
                      &[&collection_parent_path, &collection_id, &document_id, &subscription_id]).unwrap();

  // Todo: send client first batch of subscribed query data
  subscription_id
}
```

In practice, we would have this subscription function also return the initial query results as indicated in the todo.

## Next up

We can now read and write documents to our database and subscribe to document
changes, but we can't query collections based on document data. Let's fix that.
