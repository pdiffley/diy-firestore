# Transactions

Firestore allows users to perform optimistic client side transactions and so will we.

This is not too difficult to support. The first thing to notice is that our
document proto includes the `update_id` for a document. This mean that when our
client reads a document it also receives the update id for that document. To
allow client side transactions we just need to provide an endpoint that lets a
client specify a set of writes to perform along with a list of documents that
need to be identical to when the client read them.

We will create a struct to specify the details of a write operation

```rust
pub struct TransactionOperationValue {
  operation: TransactionOperation,
  document: Document,
  relevant_composite_groups: Vec<CompositeFieldGroup>,
}

pub enum TransactionOperation {
  Write,
  Delete,
}
```

Then we will provide a function that takes a list of previously read documents
and the list of write operations the transaction will perform.

```rust
pub fn commit_transaction(
  sql_transaction: &mut Transaction, 
  user_id: &UserId, 
  read_documents: &[Document], 
  write_operations: &[TransactionOperationValue]) -> bool 
{
  for document in read_documents {
    if document_has_changed(sql_transaction, document) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  for operation in write_operations {
    match operation.operation {
      TransactionOperation::Write => 
        write_document(sql_transaction, user_id, operation.document.clone(),
          &operation.relevant_composite_groups),
      TransactionOperation::Delete => {
        let collection_parent_path = operation.document.id
          .clone().unwrap().collection_parent_path;
        let collection_id = operation.document.id
          .clone().unwrap().collection_id;
        let document_id = operation.document.id.clone().unwrap().document_id;
        delete_document(sql_transaction, user_id, &collection_parent_path, 
          &collection_id, &document_id, &operation.relevant_composite_groups)
      }
    }
  }

  true
}

fn document_has_changed(
  transaction: &mut Transaction, 
  document: &Document) -> bool 
{
  let collection_parent_path = document.id
    .clone().unwrap().collection_parent_path;
  let collection_id = document.id.clone().unwrap().collection_id;
  let document_id = document.id.clone().unwrap().document_id;
  let update_id = document.update_id.clone();

  return if let Some(update_id) = update_id {
    transaction.query(
      "SELECT 1 
      FROM documents 
      WHERE collection_parent_path=$1 and collection_id=$2 and document_id=$3 
      and update_id=$4",
      &[&collection_parent_path, &collection_id, &document_id, &update_id],
    ).unwrap().len() == 0
  } else {
    transaction.query(
      "SELECT 1 
      FROM documents 
      WHERE collection_parent_path=$1 and collection_id=$2 and document_id=$3",
      &[&collection_parent_path, &collection_id, &document_id],
    ).unwrap().len() == 0
  };
}
```

If the `update_id` for one of the `read_documents` has changed, the transaction
fails. Otherwise, we apply the set of write operations. It will be the
responsibility of the client library to make keep track the documents read in a
transaction.

Providing an `update_id` for our documents, allows us identify when the document
retrieved by a client is out of date. The side affect of performing transactions
this way is that our writes cannot be sent to the database until after we have
performed all of the reads in the transaction.

## Next up

We are getting into some of the cooler features of Firestore. Next
we'll provide support for subscriptions to documents and collections.
